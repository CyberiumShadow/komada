  msg.channel.sendMessage(`The following repository, called \`GuideBot\`, is on the surface just the code for @GuideBot#2992 ... But secretly, it's a command handler example with explanations that will help you in implementing and using it. No secret module being used, no magic trick - just code that is easy enough to understand and use. It even has a built-in "reload" and "help" command and a few basic other commands you can look at to understand what's going on! It will also be expanded in the future so watch that repo, boys and girls.
